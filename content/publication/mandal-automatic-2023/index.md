abstract: With the dynamic political and economic environments, the ever-changing
  stock markets generate large amounts of data daily. Acquiring up-to-date data is
  crucial to enhancing predictive precision in stock price behavior studies. However,
  preparing the dataset manually can be challenging and time-demanding. The stock
  market analysis usually revolves around specific indices such as S&P500, Nasdaq,
  Dow Jones, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), etc. It is necessary to analyze all
  the companies of any particular index. While raw data are accessible from diverse
  financial websites, these resources are tailored for individual company data retrieval
  and there is a big gap between what is available and what is needed to generate
  large datasets. Python emerges as a valuable tool for comprehensively collecting
  all constituent stocks within a given index. While certain online sources offer
  code snippets for limited dataset generation, a comprehensive and unified script
  is yet to be developed and publicly available. Therefore, we present a comprehensive
  and consolidated code resource that facilitates the extraction of updated datasets
  for any particular time period and for any specific stock market index and closes
  the gap. The code is available at https://github.com/amp1590/automatic_stock_data_collection.

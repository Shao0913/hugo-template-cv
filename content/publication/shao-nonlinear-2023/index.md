abstract: Graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has been used successfully in
  various applications. Existing methods leverage the graph structure and labeled
  samples for classification. Label Propagation (LP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
  both iteratively pass messages on graphs, where LP propagates node labels through
  edges and GNN aggregates node features from the neighborhood. Recently, combining
  LP and GNN has led to improved performance. However, utilizing labels and features
  jointly in higher-order graphs has not been explored. Therefore, we propose Nonlinear
  Correct and Smooth (NLCS), which improves the existing post-processing approach
  by incorporating non-linearity and higher-order representation into the residual
  propagation to handle intricate node relationships effectively. Systematic evaluations
  show that our method achieves remarkable average improvements of 13.71% over base
  prediction and 2.16% over the state-of-the-art post-processing method on six commonly
  used datasets. Comparisons and analyses show our method effectively utilizes labels
  and features jointly in higher-order graphs to resolve challenging graph relationships.
